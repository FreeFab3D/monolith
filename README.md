## Repo Layout

### Build Photos
Various photos showing close-ups of the machine to help while building. 

### Firmware
Marlin firmware for the RAMBo Arduino control boards. One version is for the Monoliths using an LCD displau board.

### Settings
Screen shots showing settings for Repetier-Host and Slic3r config ini profiles. 

### STLs
All the plastic parts required to build the Monolith. In some cases more than one version of the same part are included, ie: Y-foot and Z-rod caps. You can choose which version you like best. 

All parts should be printed using good quality ABS except the control board box and lid, which should be printed in PLA. Micro extruder needs at least 30% infill (40% is better), but other parts should use between 20% and 30% infill.
